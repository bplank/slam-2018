"""
Duolingo SLAM Shared Task - Baseline Model (provided by organizers, ported to sklearn)

This baseline model loads the training and test data that you pass in via --train and --test arguments for a particular
track (course), storing the resulting data in InstanceData objects, one for each instance. The code then creates the
features we'll use for logistic regression, storing the resulting LogisticRegressionInstance objects, then uses those to
train a regularized logistic model with SGD, and then makes predictions for the test set and dumps them to a CSV file
specified with the --pred argument, in a format appropriate to be read in and graded by the eval.py script.

We elect to use two different classes, InstanceData and LogisticRegressionInstance, to delineate the boundary between
the two purposes of this code; the first being to act as a user-friendly interface to the data, and the second being to
train and run a baseline model as an example. Competitors may feel free to use InstanceData in their own code, but
should consider replacing the LogisticRegressionInstance with a class more appropriate for the model they construct.

This code is written to be compatible with both Python 2 or 3, at the expense of dependency on the future library. This
code does not depend on any other Python libraries besides future.
